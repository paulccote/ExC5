## Introduction

This will be a rewrite of ExChillusion, a chat application that allows for plugin-based channels.

## Features
* Channel-based, similiar to IRC, but flexible because plugins can be freely chosen for channels
* A wide variety of plugins is already provided (a chat plugin and even games like Connect Four, Blackjack, and Chain Reaction)
* Third-party plugins can be used to host channels, all you need is a host for your HTML file

## Upcoming features
* Upgrade from NodeWebkit to Electron
* Migration to React for UI
* Modernized UI flow
* P2P communications with end-to-end encryption
* Several plugins planned (games/pool, utility/whiteboard, entertainment/youtube-together, etc.)
* Existing whiteboard utility will be ported to ExC
